# Port-Scanner-With-Python
This Python port scanner lets me quickly and safely check multiple targets for open ports, known vulnerabilities, and important services. It supports IP ranges, hostnames, and custom ports, and generates reports in text, CSV, or detailed formats. Perfect for hands-on learning in network security and practical cybersecurity labs.

## Overview

This Python port scanner is designed to help me explore network security in a practical, hands-on way. It allows scanning multiple targets—IP addresses, ranges, or hostnames—for open ports, known vulnerabilities, and essential services. The project is perfect for learning real-world cybersecurity techniques in a controlled environment.

## Key Features
- Supports both quick scans for common ports and thorough scans with custom ranges.
- Validates and resolves hostnames or IP addresses safely.
- Checks for important vulnerabilities on ports like FTP, Telnet, SMB, RDP, and HTTP.
- Uses multithreading for faster scanning.
- Exports results to text files, CSVs, or detailed report formats for easy analysis.

## Why I Built It
- Hands-on practice with networking and cybersecurity fundamentals.
- Understanding port-based vulnerabilities and their implications.
- Sharpening Python scripting skills in a practical project.
- Prepares for real-world penetration testing and security monitoring scenarios.

## Learning Outcome 
This port scanner is a practical tool for cybersecurity learning and practice. It can be used for network reconnaissance, identifying open ports, detecting potential vulnerabilities, and generating actionable reports. Security professionals and students alike can leverage it to strengthen defensive strategies and prepare for real-world penetration testing scenarios.
